# Fully Functional Simple Calculator

## A fully functional calculator project written in HTML, CSS, and JS

This project is one of many from progressing through "The Odin Project" and their curriculum.
Every part of this project is written by myself with no external help (other than googling).
Here are some features of the calculator:

- Fully functional operations including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Fully functional CLEAR and DELETE buttons allowing for calculation clearing/editing
- Secondary "display" to display previous calculations while primary display is used to display answers
