# Fully Functional Simple Calculator - TOP

## A fully functional calculator project written in HTML, CSS, and JS

This project is one of many from progressing through "The Odin Project" and their curriculum.
Every part of this project is written by myself with no external help (other than googling).
Here are some features of the calculator:

- Fully functional operations including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Fully functional CLEAR and DELETE buttons allowing for calculation clearing/editing
- Secondary "display" to display previous calculations while primary display is used to display answers

## Some future steps:
- Would like to solve the problem of overflowing characters when the integers/digits exceed the size of the display
    - Can be solved using a font-size reduction depending on size of string, using scientific notation
    - Can also use overflow:hidden, however, this isn't a good solution as the user will not be able to see the entire answer
